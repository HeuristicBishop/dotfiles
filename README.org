* Intro
  This is my dotfiles repo.

  The idea is pretty simple, using gnu ~stow~ to manage the dotfiles, copying some others
  on the internet who did this before I did.

* stow.sh
  Instead of running ~stow~ directly, I have a wrapper script called ~stow.sh~ that reads
  an optional config file, ~stow.local~ that is git ignored.  This allows me to tailer
  what I want stowed, depending on what environment I'm in.

  If there is no local config file, ~stow.sh~ attempts to just stow everything.

* Ignoring certain directories
  Some directories, I never want to stow.  They are just kept around for hanging onto
  plist files and things like that that I find valuable.

  To make sure ~stow.sh~, and by extension ~stow~ do not stow them, I use a local ignore
  file to ignore everything in them.  E.g.:

  : plist/.stow-local-ignore

  with an ignore of:

  : .*
