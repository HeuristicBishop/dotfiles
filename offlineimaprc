# The types supported are Maildir and IMAP.

[Repository Gmail-Remote]
# A repository using Gmail's IMAP interface.  Any configuration
# parameter of `IMAP` type repositories can be used here.  Only
# `remoteuser` (or `remoteusereval` ) is mandatory.  Default values
# for other parameters are OK, and you should not need fiddle with
# those.
#
# The Gmail repository will use hard-coded values for `remotehost`,
# `remoteport`, `tunnel` and `ssl`.  (See
# http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=78799&topic=12814)
# Any attempt to set those parameters will be silently ignored.

# Deleting a message from a Gmail folder via the IMAP interface will
# just remove that folder's label from the message: the message will
# continue to exist in the '[Gmail]/All Mail' folder.  If `realdelete`
# is set to `True`, then deleted messages will really be deleted
# during `offlineimap` sync, by moving them to the '[Gmail]/Trash'
# folder.  BEWARE: this will delete a messages from *all folders* it
# belongs to!
